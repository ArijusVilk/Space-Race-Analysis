# Space Race Analysis and Visualization
![rockeeee](https://github.com/ArijusVilk/Space-Race-Analysis/assets/119447450/69a9505b-0823-42a7-93d6-19a2880810c7)
## Project Overview:
The Space Race project analyzes over 4300 space missions from 1957 to 2020. We look at which countries and organizations are involved, when the missions happened, what they aimed to achieve, their success rates, costs, and whether the rockets used are still active. We aim to spot trends in launch numbers, see how historical events like the Cold War influenced space activities, and understand which countries and organizations have been most active in space exploration. Our goal is to provide clear insights into how space exploration has evolved over time and its key drivers.

## Impact:
During 1962-1970, the USSR saw a big increase in missions, peaking at 88 per year. But by 2020, it dropped to fewer than 10 launches. China, from 2010-2020, had over 35 launches, less than half of what the USSR did. The US stayed stable with about 21 launches per year throughout the dataset. The Cold War era was pivotal for the USSR's dominance in space exploration. However, after the collapse of the Soviet Union, space missions were largely abandoned, and Russia remained in the shadow of America. This historical context highlights the shifting dynamics in space exploration over time. 
For the price analysis, it is hard to determine how many money were spent on missions in USSR/RUS because most of the records were hidden. NASA remains the leader of organisations, spending over 61 billion dollars total. (The results may change if you replace NaN values with mean or drop them)

This project offers valuable insights for people who are interested in history and wants to understand the world's distribution of space launches.
From this project I learned that Kazachstan was one of the main locations of rocket launches, though the country belonged to USSR.
